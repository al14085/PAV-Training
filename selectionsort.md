# Selection Sort

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

1) The subarray which is already sorted.
2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.

## Step-by-step example:
Here is an example of this sort algorithm sorting five elements:
```php
arr[] = 64 25 12 22 11

// Find the minimum element in arr[0...4]
// and place it at beginning
11 25 12 22 64

// Find the minimum element in arr[1...4]
// and place it at beginning of arr[1...4]
11 12 25 22 64

// Find the minimum element in arr[2...4]
// and place it at beginning of arr[2...4]
11 12 22 25 64

// Find the minimum element in arr[3...4]
// and place it at beginning of arr[3...4]
11 12 22 25 64 
```

## Flowchart of the Selection Sort:

## Following is the implementations of the Selection Sort:
```php
<?php 
// PHP program for implementation  
// of selection sort  
function selection_sort(&$arr, $n)  
{ 
    for($i = 0; $i < $n ; $i++) 
    { 
        $low = $i; 
        for($j = $i + 1; $j < $n ; $j++) 
        { 
            if ($arr[$j] < $arr[$low]) 
            { 
                $low = $j; 
            } 
        } 
          
        // swap the minimum value to $ith node 
        if ($arr[$i] > $arr[$low]) 
        { 
            $tmp = $arr[$i]; 
            $arr[$i] = $arr[$low]; 
            $arr[$low] = $tmp; 
        } 
    } 
} 
  
// Driver Code 
$arr = array(64, 25, 12, 22, 11); 
$len = count($arr); 
selection_sort($arr, $len); 
echo "Sorted array : \n";  
  
for ($i = 0; $i < $len; $i++)  
    echo $arr[$i] . " ";  
  
?>  
```

## Output 
```php
Sorted array:
11 12 22 25 64
```

## Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n2) as there are two nested loops.
- Auxiliary Space: O(1)
- Sorting In Place: Yes
- Stable : The default implementation is not stable.
